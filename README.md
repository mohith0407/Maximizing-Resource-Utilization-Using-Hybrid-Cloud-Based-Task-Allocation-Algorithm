# Maximizing-Resource-Utilization-Using-Hybrid-Cloud-Based-Task-Allocation-Algorithm

In this study, Our team proposed a hybrid algorithm combining
the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Particle Swarm Opti-
mization (PSO) techniques to improve task allocation in cloud
computing environments. Our primary goal was to address the
challenges of VM overload and underload, thereby enhancing
resource utilization. The empirical results demonstrated that
our hybrid approach offers a marginal improvement in resource
utilization accuracy, as indicated by the fitness score, when
compared to traditional ABC and PSO algorithms. Despite
this improvement, the study highlights the potential for further
advancement in task allocation algorithms for cloud comput-
ing. Future research could focus on refining the hybridization
process, optimizing algorithmic parameters, and exploring
alternative optimization techniques to achieve better results.
Additionally, assessing the scalability and robustness of our
approach across various cloud environments and workload
scenarios would provide deeper insights into its practical ap-
plicability. While our research marks a step forward in tackling
the challenges of task allocation in cloud computing, it also
underscores the vast opportunities for enhancing the efficiency
and performance of these algorithms. Continued exploration
and innovation in this area are essential for meeting the 
evolving demands of cloud computing environments
